          Rooney’s versatility, work rate, and passion on the field were
          unmatched. He could score from anywhere, assist teammates, and even
          drop deep to help defensively. He played with heart every single

          Paul Scholes was Manchester United’s midfield magician, known for his
          pinpoint passing, long-range screamers, and intelligent movement.
          Despite his quiet personality off the pitch, he let his feet do all
          the talking.

          Scholes had vision like a footballing prophet. He made impossible
          passes look easy and could dictate the tempo of any game with just a
          few touches. Also, his long-range shots were pure beauty.
