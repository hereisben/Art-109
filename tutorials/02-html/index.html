      <h2>Wayne Rooney</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>

        Manchester United and the England national team. With his aggressive
        playing style and exceptional goal-scoring ability, he became one of the
        greatest strikers in Premier League history.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I Like Him</h3>
      <p>
        Rooney’s versatility, work rate, and passion on the field were
        unmatched. He could score from anywhere, assist teammates, and even drop
        deep to help defensively. He played with heart every single match.
      </p>
      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>

      <p>
        Paul Scholes was Manchester United’s midfield magician, known for his
        pinpoint passing, long-range screamers, and intelligent movement.
        Despite his quiet personality off the pitch, he let his feet do all the
        talking.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I Like Him</h3>
      <p>
        Scholes had vision like a footballing prophet. He made impossible passes
        look easy and could dictate the tempo of any game with just a few
        touches. Also, his long-range shots were pure beauty.
      </p>
      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>Tackled like he was playing street football with no rules.</p>
      <p>If “Let me try from 30 yards” was a person.</p>

        bend the ball in ways that defied physics. He played for Manchester
        United, Real Madrid, and the England national team, leaving a mark
        everywhere he went.
      </p>

        top-notch. He wasn’t just about looks—he had pure talent, leadership,

      <h2>Park Ji Sung</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Park Ji-sung, the ultimate team player, was one of Manchester United’s
        most underrated midfielders. His stamina, tactical intelligence, and
        ability to perform in big matches made him a key asset for Sir Alex
        Ferguson.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I Like Him</h3>
      <p>
        He never stopped running, never complained, and always delivered when it
        mattered. His ability to shut down opponents and contribute both
        offensively and defensively made him a legend in my eyes.

        creativity and audacity made every game exciting.
